## Description
I decided to build a react portfolio so I could create a place to share my projects when applying for jobs and to share my work with fellow developers. This porfolio contains a about me section, a contact section and a resume section. This project uses a navigation tab to be to switch each section with ease. During this module I was able to learn more about building websites as well as use commonly used technologies.
